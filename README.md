# Code of Conduct

We are committed to making #n-o-d-e an inclusive and welcoming IRC channel for everyone.

Sadly, technology communities have a notorious reputation for harassment. We've set these ground rules to make it abundantly clear that this kind of behaviour is not acceptable, so that everyone can feel comfortable participating.

Everyone who uses #n-o-d-e is required to abide by this code of conduct, both at any event and on any online channels. We will not tolerate harassment of participants or discriminatory behaviour of any form. Specifically:

* Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise prejudiced behaviour. *ANY* prejudiced behaviour.
* Do not harass people. Stalking, unconsented physical contact, or sexual attention is harassment. Dressing or acting in a certain way is not consent. Absence of "no" is not "yes".
* Every participant's personal space is their own. If you are asked to leave someone alone, you must respect this.
* Aggression and elitism are not welcome â€” nobody should be afraid to ask questions.

If you break these rules, we may expel you from the channel or ban you at our discretion.

If you are being harassed or witness a breach of this code of conduct, you can get in touch with us in the following ways:

* Find an operator (they'll be clearly identifiable with "@" by their name or something similar depending on your client) and let them know. All our volunteer staff will be briefed on how to handle a harassment situation.

If you have any comments or queries, please ask in channel or private message an operator.
